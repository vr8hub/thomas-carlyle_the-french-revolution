			<h3>Chapter 1.2.V.<br/> Astræa Redux without Cash.</h3>
			<p>Observe, however, beyond the Atlantic, has not the new day verily dawned! Democracy, as we said, is born; storm-girt, is struggling for life and victory. A sympathetic France rejoices over the Rights of Man; in all saloons, it is said, What a spectacle! Now too behold our Deane, our Franklin, American Plenipotentiaries, here in position soliciting;<a href="#linknote-35" id="linknoteref-35" name="linknoteref-35">[35]</a> the sons of the Saxon Puritans, with their Old-Saxon temper, Old-Hebrew culture, sleek Silas, sleek Benjamin, here on such errand, among the light children of Heathenism, Monarchy, Sentimentalism, and the Scarlet-woman. A spectacle indeed; over which saloons may cackle joyous; though Kaiser Joseph, questioned on it, gave this answer, most unexpected from a Philosophe: “Madame, the trade I live by is that of royalist (<i>Mon métier à moi c’est d’être royaliste</i>).”</p>
			<p>So thinks light Maurepas too; but the wind of Philosophism and force of public opinion will blow him round. Best wishes, meanwhile, are sent; clandestine privateers armed. Paul Jones shall equip his <i>Bon Homme Richard:</i> weapons, military stores can be smuggled over (if the English do not seize them); wherein, once more Beaumarchais, dimly as the Giant Smuggler becomes visible⁠—filling his own lank pocket withal. But surely, in any case, France should have a Navy. For which great object were not now the time: now when that proud Termagant of the Seas has her hands full? It is true, an impoverished Treasury cannot build ships; but the hint once given (which Beaumarchais says he gave), this and the other loyal Seaport, Chamber of Commerce, will build and offer them. Goodly vessels bound into the waters; a <i>Ville de Paris</i>, Leviathan of ships.</p>
			<p>And now when gratuitous three-deckers dance there at anchor, with streamers flying; and eleutheromaniac Philosophedom grows ever more clamorous, what can a Maurepas do⁠—but gyrate? Squadrons cross the ocean: Gages, Lees, rough Yankee Generals, ‘with woollen night-caps under their hats,’ present arms to the far-glancing Chivalry of France; and new-born Democracy sees, not without amazement, ‘Despotism tempered by Epigrams fight at her side. So, however, it is. King’s forces and heroic volunteers; Rochambeaus, Bouillés, Lameths, Lafayettes, have drawn their swords in this sacred quarrel of mankind;⁠—shall draw them again elsewhere, in the strangest way.</p>
			<p class="p2">Off Ushant some naval thunder is heard. In the course of which did our young Prince, Duke de Chartres, ‘hide in the hold;’ or did he materially, by <i>active</i> heroism, contribute to the victory? Alas, by a second edition, we learn that there was no victory; or that English Keppel had it.<a href="#linknote-36" id="linknoteref-36" name="linknoteref-36">[36]</a> Our poor young Prince gets his Opera plaudits changed into mocking tehees; and cannot become Grand-Admiral⁠—the source to him of woes which one may call endless.</p>
			<p>Woe also for <i>Ville de Paris</i>, the Leviathan of ships! English Rodney has clutched it, and led it home, with the rest; so successful was his new ‘manœuvre of breaking the enemy’s line.’<a href="#linknote-37" id="linknoteref-37" name="linknoteref-37">[37]</a> It seems as if, according to Louis XV., ‘France were never to have a Navy.’ Brave Suffren must return from Hyder Ally and the Indian Waters; with small result; yet with great glory for ‘six <i>non-defeats;</i>⁠—which indeed, with such seconding as he had, one may reckon heroic. Let the old sea-hero rest now, honoured of France, in his native Cevennes mountains; send smoke, not of gunpowder, but mere culinary smoke, through the old chimneys of the Castle of Jalès⁠—which one day, in other hands, shall have other fame. Brave Lapérouse shall by and by lift anchor, on philanthropic Voyage of Discovery; for the King knows Geography.<a href="#linknote-38" id="linknoteref-38" name="linknoteref-38">[38]</a> But, alas, this also will not prosper: the brave Navigator goes, and returns not; the Seekers search far seas for him in vain. He has vanished trackless into blue Immensity; and only some mournful mysterious shadow of him hovers long in all heads and hearts.</p>
			<p>Neither, while the War yet lasts, will Gibraltar surrender. Not though Crillon, Nassau-Siegen, with the ablest projectors extant, are there; and Prince Condé and Prince d’Artois have hastened to help. Wondrous leather-roofed Floating-batteries, set afloat by French-Spanish <i>Pacte de Famille</i>, give gallant summons: to which, nevertheless, Gibraltar answers Plutonically, with mere torrents of redhot iron⁠—as if stone Calpe had become a throat of the Pit; and utters such a Doom’s-blast of a No, as all men must credit.<a href="#linknote-39" id="linknoteref-39" name="linknoteref-39">[39]</a></p>
			<p>And so, with this loud explosion, the noise of War has ceased; an Age of Benevolence may hope, for ever. Our noble volunteers of Freedom have returned, to be her missionaries. Lafayette, as the matchless of his time, glitters in the Versailles Œil-de-Beouf; has his Bust set up in the Paris HÃ´tel-de-Ville. Democracy stands inexpugnable, immeasurable, in her New World; has even a foot lifted towards the Old;⁠—and our French Finances, little strengthened by such work, are in no healthy way.</p>
			<p>What to do with the Finance? This indeed is the great question: a small but most black weather-symptom, which no radiance of universal hope can cover. We saw Turgot cast forth from the Controllership, with shrieks⁠—for want of a Fortunatus’ Purse. As little could M. de Clugny manage the duty; or indeed do anything, but consume his wages; attain ‘a place in History,’ where as an ineffectual shadow thou beholdest him still lingering;⁠—and let the duty manage itself. Did Genevese Necker <i>possess</i> such a Purse, then? He possessed banker’s skill, banker’s honesty; <i>credit</i> of all kinds, for he had written Academic Prize Essays, struggled for India Companies, given dinners to Philosophes, and ‘realised a fortune in twenty years.’ He possessed, further, a taciturnity and solemnity; of depth, or else of dulness. How singular for Celadon Gibbon, false swain as he had proved; whose father, keeping most probably his own gig, ‘would not hear of such a union,’⁠—to find now his forsaken Demoiselle Curchod sitting in the high places of the world, as Minister’s Madame, and ‘Necker not jealous!’<a href="#linknote-40" id="linknoteref-40" name="linknoteref-40">[40]</a></p>
			<p>A new young Demoiselle, one day to be famed as a Madame and De StaÃ«l, was romping about the knees of the Decline and Fall: the lady Necker founds Hospitals; gives solemn Philosophe dinner-parties, to cheer her exhausted Controller-General. Strange things have happened: by clamour of Philosophism, management of Marquis de Pezay, and Poverty constraining even Kings. And so Necker, Atlas-like, sustains the burden of the Finances, for five years long?<a href="#linknote-41" id="linknoteref-41" name="linknoteref-41">[41]</a> Without wages, for he refused such; cheered only by Public Opinion, and the ministering of his noble Wife. With many thoughts in him, it is hoped;⁠—which, however, he is shy of uttering. His <i>Compte Rendu</i>, published by the royal permission, fresh sign of a New Era, shows wonders;⁠—which what but the genius of some Atlas-Necker can prevent from becoming portents? In Necker’s head too there is a whole pacific French Revolution, of its kind; and in that taciturn dull depth, or deep dulness, ambition enough.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, alas, his Fotunatus’ Purse turns out to be little other than the old ‘<i>vectigal</i> of Parsimony.’ Nay, he too has to produce his scheme of taxing: Clergy, Noblesse to be taxed; Provincial Assemblies, and the rest⁠—like a mere Turgot! The expiring M. de Maurepas must gyrate one other time. Let Necker also depart; not unlamented.</p>
			<p>Great in a private station, Necker looks on from the distance; abiding his time. ‘Eighty thousand copies’ of his new Book, which he calls <i>Administration des Finances</i>, will be sold in few days. He is gone; but shall return, and that more than once, borne by a whole shouting Nation. Singular Controller-General of the Finances; once Clerk in Thelusson’s Bank!</p>
